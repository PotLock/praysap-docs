# Shahada Verification Process

To ensure the authenticity and sanctity of our prayer community, PRAYSAP requires verification of your Muslim identity through the Shahada process.

## What is Shahada Verification?

The **Shahada** (Arabic: الشهادة‎) is the Islamic declaration of faith. Our verification process ensures that all community members are practicing Muslims, creating a trusted environment for prayer and spiritual connection.

**Important:** This process is designed to be respectful, private, and secure. We understand the sensitivity of faith verification and handle it with the utmost care.
