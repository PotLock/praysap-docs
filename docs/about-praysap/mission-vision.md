# Mission and Vision

## Our Mission

PRAYSAP exists to **connect Muslims globally for prayer and community**, breaking down geographical barriers and creating a unified ummah in the digital age.

We believe that prayer is more powerful when shared, and that technology can serve as a bridge to bring believers together across continents, cultures, and circumstances.

## Our Vision

To become the **world's leading platform for Islamic prayer and community engagement**, where every Muslim feels connected to their global family through the power of collective worship.

### Core Principles

**🕌 Unity in Worship**  
Prayer transcends borders, languages, and cultures. We facilitate this unity through technology.

**📿 Authentic Islamic Values**  
Every feature and interaction on PRAYSAP is designed with Islamic principles at its core.

**🌍 Global Accessibility**  
Making prayer and community accessible to Muslims worldwide, regardless of location or circumstance.

**🤝 Community First**  
Building genuine connections and relationships within the Muslim community.

**🔒 Trust and Security**

- **Preserving Islamic authenticity** while embracing helpful technology
- **Building community resilience** through shared spiritual experiences
